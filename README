TM_Project Bundle for TextMate 2
================================

This adds a little bit of support for TextMate 1 projects.  At the moment, it will open up a folder from
your project and the files that were open when it saved, all while not repeatedly crashing TextMate (I hope).

In the future, maybe there will be a tiny command added to save the currently open windows into the project.
This might be unlikely since it looks like tm_projects are on their way out anyway.

Please report any bugs right away so I can get them fixed.  Either use Github to open an issue or send a short
message to the TextMate support mailing list and I'll get back to you ASAP.
